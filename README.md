# InventoryManagement
Shoprite Inventory Management System is designed to help administrators and shop attendant to collect and keep all the data needed in a structured manner using a
database management system.

Adminstrator can add new users(Employed) to the systems user section
Administrator can navigate to all the sections avialable to him which includes
1. Sales Section
2. Customer Section
3. User Section
4. Order Section
5. Products Section


Attendant can also update all the sales in the system and even go through all the list of customers who shop at Shoprite. Also Attendants do not have all the privilages of administration hence that cannot access every section of the system. They only have access to 
1. Sales Section
2. Customer Section
3. Order Section

For additional security, users will have to specify thier role that is either an Administrator or an Attendant when accessing the platform. Moreover, once they specify that, the software is designed to be capable of crosschecking with the database to see if the information provided by the user is really accurate. After the confimation, now the user can access either the Administration section or the Attendant section accordingly.

Since attendants do not have authorization to the user section and Product section, only the administrator can make changes with those section. Also administrator can either change the role of a user of delete the user from the system.

Attendant can record dialy sales, add customers to the system and also enter every order purchased by a customer.
